* Q: C﻿an I walk up to get a tattoo at the Expo or do I need to schedule and appointment? 

W﻿ith over 300 Tattoo Artists on the floor most will be taking walk ups throughout the weekend. However, if you are desiring to get a tattoo from a particular artist we highly suggest arranging an appointment directly with the artists. You can do this by sending a DM to the artists through their instagram page or contacting them directly through their shop.  Visit our Artists page where you can view the attending artists, click on their profile and it will take you directly to their instagram page. Please be sure to have your government issued ID as no person under the age of 18 can get a tattoo.  No ID = No Tattoo
